# Image operator Learning using Convolutional Neural Networks
 
This repo integrates CNNs, through TensorFlow, into the TRIOSlib library. Applications of the library include text segmentation, staff-line removal in music scores and image binarization.


## Installation
Look at https://www.tensorflow.org/install/ for instructions on how to install TensorFlow. 
TRIOSlib can be installed using pip:

```
$ pip install trios
```

## Getting started
This [notebook](./cnn_trioslib.ipynb) shows an example on how to use image operator learning for text segmentation.
