The new upcoming TRIOSlib version will use and work together with
many other scientific packages for Python. We are using [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
and [Scipy](http://www.scipy.org/) extensively to deal with matrix 
operations and [Theano](www.deeplearning.net/software/theano/) to 
perform GPU operations. We are also integrating
classifiers from Scikit-learn into TRIOSlib, so most classifiers
can be used to train W-operators. 

Some code of TRIOSlib 2 is already in the repositories and more
will appear in the following weeks. Meanwhile, most of the old
site will be rewritten to show the new capabilites of TRIOSlib 2.
