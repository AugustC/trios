Summary: TRIOSlib will use a new file format to store operators. Old operators can still be read using the legacy package.

The file formats used in TRIOSlib 1.0 were rather rigid and did not allow for
many extensions or user made classes. 
For this reason we are reformulating the file formats used in TRIOSlib in 
version 2. Now the files are saved using the JSON format and the **Serializable**
class allows anyone to implement new parts of TRIOSlib and, as long these classes
are in the PYTHONPATH, everything will just work out. 

The old files will still be readable using the **trios.legacy.io** package. 
This package will contain methods to read the old TRIOSlib files and 
return objects from the new API. The old Python API is being deprecated, although
most of the code can almost instantly converted to the new API.
