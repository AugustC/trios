Summary: TRIOSlib now has a new website. Also, recent developments will make it much easier to work with TRIOSlib in Python.

After some quiet time in the repositories, there are many new things. First of all, the site is now written using Pelican instead of my custom site generator. This makes it much easier to maintain it and to write a proper development blog. Hopefully there will be more information about it from now on. 

After almost 15 years, the code is also being completely reworked and many parts will be replaced by Python. Although it will not be possible to use TRIOSlib directly from C, the Python API will get much richer and will be the recommended way of using TRIOSlib. Everything is being reworked to be compatible with NumPy and other scientific python tools. These changes are going to appear in the repository in the next weeks and hopefully it will be possible to install TRIOSlib directly from PyPi some months from now.
