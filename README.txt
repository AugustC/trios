TRIOS - Training Image Operatros from Samples
=================================================

TRIOS is a toolbox for Image Operator Learning. Given a set of examples 
containing an input image and the desired output, it builds an Image 
Operator that transforms the input images into the desired outputs with
minimum error. TRIOS approaches this problem using Machine Learning 
techniques to build a local transformation of the images. 
More details about this process are described at [1]. To learn how
to use TRIOS visit our tutorials page [2].
